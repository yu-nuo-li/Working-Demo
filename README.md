# [Automated Inventory Management System](https://github.com/yu-nuo-li/Working-Demo/blob/main/Auto_Inventory_Eng.py)
This is an automated Inventory Management System designed all by myself when I was taking the internship in business analytics and operations. It is a Streamlit-based inventory tracking and reporting tool built to support daily operational workflows. The system standardizes inventory data by automatically carrying forward opening stock from prior days, consolidating sales data across multiple CSV sources and optionally adjusting figures based on exchange or return records. It computes end-of-day inventory in a auditable manner and presents results through an interactive dashboard with conditional formatting, summary metrics and exportable CSV/Excel reports. It's suitable for internal operations, finance and supply chain decision-making.
